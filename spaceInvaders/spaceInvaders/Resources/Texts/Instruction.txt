Space Invaders is a type of fixed shooter game, meaning that the entire game screen
 is visible from the beginning to the end of the gameplay.
 The objective is to destroy four rows of aliens,
 with 14 enemies in each row, which move horizontally back
 and forth and descend towards the bottom of the screen.
 The player defeats an alien by shooting it from the player's ship,
 earning a certain number of points in the process.

Every time 14 aliens are destroyed, their speed increases.
 Defeating one wave of aliens brings the next wave, which is more difficult
 due to the increased speed of the aliens,

The aliens try to destroy the player's ship by shooting at it while simultaneously
 advancing towards the bottom of the screen. If they reach the bottom,
 the invasion is successful, and the game ends. A special mystery ship
 occasionally moves across the top of the screen.
 Destroying this ship rewards the player with extra points,
 and the destroyed ship drops a cargo which, if caught by the player,
 increases the player's shooting frequency or adds an extra life.

The player's ship is protected by four stationary defense positions,
 which are gradually destroyed by enemy fire and occasional player shots.
 The player's task is to score as many points as possible by destroying aliens.

Scoring:
    Enemy type I 10 points (shoot vertically downwards)
    Enemy type II 20 points (faster projectiles)
    Enemy type III 30 points (faster projectiles + multiply shoots)
    Mystery ship 200 points

The player loses when the aliens reach the bottom level of the screen where
 the player's ship moves or if the player loses all their lives by being hit
 by enemy projectiles. Initially, the player has three lives, which is the maximum number.
