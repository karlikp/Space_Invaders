# ðŸ‘¾ Space Invaders
In the game, your objective is to contain an invasion by controlling a spaceship and shooting at the invading forces. 
You must also dodge their attacks to survive, as your ship has only 3 lives. By hitting invaders, you earn points. 
Occasionally, a UFO flies across the upper part of the screen. When hit, the UFO drops power-ups that can help you in your mission.

### ðŸ’¬ Context of the project:
This was my main project from the fourth semester of my studies.
I developed it as part of a computer programming course.

### ðŸš€ My motivation:
I wanted to create this game because when I was a child, my favorite game was Chicken Invaders.
 It is a game where you control a spaceship and fight with chickens that want to take over the world.
