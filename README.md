# ðŸ‘¾ Space Invaders
Space Invaders is a classic arcade shooter game where players control a ship with laser cannon to defend Earth by destroying waves of descending alien invaders before they reach the ground.

### ðŸ’¬ Context of the project:
This was my main project from the fourth semester of my studies.
I developed it as part of a computer programming course.

### ðŸš€ My motivation:
I wanted to create this game because when I was a child, my favorite game was Chicken Invaders.
 It is a game where you control a spaceship and fight with chickens that want to take over the world.
